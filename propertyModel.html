          <p>The Interoperability of the technical
systems in the industrial production requires the exchange of information. In the first method to exchange information, the properties will be described according
to a general Pattern in form of
system models. Using system models makes it possible to describe
the different constructional and behavioral structures. By providing all existing systems with a standard
pattern, information exchange can be done using analyzing
and transforming methods. typical approaches are SysML or
domain models such as ISO. However, on the one hand it is not always essential to use system models 
to exchange information and on the other hand it can be sometimes very complex. Another method that can be used is to classify the Structures and properties
through a few characteristics and state
variables. A description
with characteristics is less expressive that with system
models and can never replace it but it allows an easier information exchange across
the systems and is sufficient for many goals.</p>
