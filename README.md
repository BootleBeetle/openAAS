# openAAS
Development Repository for open Asset Administration Shell (openAAS) by Chair of Process Control Engineering RWTH Aachen University and ZVEI.

This repository shows the current development state of the administration shell and contains definitions, models, specifications, and prototypes. The specifications are based on previous achievements of ZVEI Workgroups.
For prototype development, we use the model based runtime environment [ACPLT/RTE](https://github.com/acplt/rte) as well as open source [OPC UA stack open62541](https://github.com/open62541/open62541) 

More information can be found here: [openAAS Project Page](http://acplt.github.io/openAAS/)
